# flickrAndroid
A simple Android app with the Flickr API

It takes the 30 most recent public photos from Flickr and displays them in a grid. Clicking one will put the image in full screen. Due to time constraints it refreshes when the orientation changes. I decided not to lock the orientation so the user can use whatever they prefer.

Features I would like to add with more time include a Progressbar, and the ability for the user to set how many pictures show up.
